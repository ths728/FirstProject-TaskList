# My Personal Project- Gomoku

## A subtitle

 Gomoku is a game on a 10x10 chessboard. Black and white chess are placed by two players (player black & player white)
 on grid one by one. When the 5 same colour chesses are placed in a straight line (horizontal, vertical and slash), 
 player with that colour win the game.
 
 ## Phase 1, task 3
 - As a user, I want to be able to determine who wins the game.
